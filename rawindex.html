            <h2>What is the Free Web Project?</h2>
            <p>
                The Free Web Project is a social experiment, devoted to making another Internet, this one completely and totally free and unregulated except by the people inside it, on a set of hitherto unused radio frequencies which will hopefully span from as low as a few kilohertz to as high as a dozen gigahertz

            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>
                Our goal is quite simply to remove the barriers that prevent us from broadcasting on varied radio frequencies. These regulations are, in America, managed by the FCC, which exploits them with expensive licenses (not just for hobbyists! Entire industries must pay thousands of dollars to use some frequencies).
                Our opinion is that the FCC should allocate thirty or so free for public use frequencies, with no required protocols or licensing, to form a global information-sharing system, starting with the United States of America.
